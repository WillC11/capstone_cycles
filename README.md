## How Do Members and Casual Users Differ?

This analysis delves into the differences between members and casual users of a ride-sharing service, focusing on their usage patterns, ride preferences, seasonal trends, and behaviors. By organising the data into key themes, we can uncover valuable insights that highlight how these user types differ in their engagement with the service.

## Executive Summary: Key Differences Between Members and Casual Users

This analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of members and casual users of a ride-sharing service, focusing on usage patterns, trends, and preferences.

### Key Insights

#### Usage Patterns

Members account for 63% of total rides, reflecting frequent and routine use, averaging 12.0 minutes per trip.

Casual users, at 37%, prefer longer, leisure-focused rides, averaging 21.1 minutes per trip.

#### Temporal Trends

Weekdays: Members peak at commuting hours (8am, 5pm), while casual users show more flexible usage.

Weekends: Both groups align in usage patterns, likely driven by use of the service as a leisure activity, with casual users matching members’ ride numbers.

#### Seasonal Behaviors

Members maintain consistent year-round activity.

Casual users are highly seasonal, with peak rides and durations in warmer months (e.g., May).

#### Rideable Preferences

Electric and classic bikes are popular across both groups.

Casual users dominate electric scooter usage (59%), showing adaptability to new options.

#### Location Trends

Popular routes include West Loop Gate to Merchandise Mart, supported by the Kinzie St Bikeway.

#### Conclusion

Members have a higer degree of consistency and routine, possibly centred around short-distance commutes. Whereas, casual users have more seasonal behaviour, likely based around leisure-based activities.

## Usage Patterns by User Type

### Total Rides

Members account for 63% of the total 5.92 million rides, while casual users make up 37%. This shows that members consistently contribute a larger share of rides. However, casual users still form a substantial portion, making up roughly one-third of all trips.

### Ride Duration

Members' average trip duration is 12.0 minutes, indicating frequent, short rides, likely for commuting or errands.

Casual Users' average trip duration is 21.1 minutes, 76% longer than members, suggesting that casual users take longer, leisure-oriented trips.

### Rides per Minute

Members peak at 5 minutes per ride and show a steep decline in rides lasting longer.

Casual users have a similar peak at 6 minutes but maintain a higher proportion of long-duration rides, further supporting their leisure-driven usage.

These patterns reveal that members use the service for routine, short-distance travel, while casual users demonstrate a preference for longer, less frequent trips.

## Temporal Trends

### Weekday Usage

Members:

Peak usage aligns with typical commuting hours: 8am and 5pm.

Sharp increases and decreases around these times suggest commuting as the primary purpose.

Casual Users:

More gradual usage increase from 4am, peaking at 5pm.

Flexible usage pattern indicates mixed purposes, including commuting and leisure.

### Weekend Usage

Both user types exhibit an inverted U-shaped usage pattern, peaking between 12pm and 4pm.

Casual users continue to increase slightly until 3pm, while members plateau earlier and maintain steady levels until 4pm.

Despite members making up 63% of total rides, casual users roughly match their weekend ride numbers, indicating a shift in behavior from weekday commuting to leisure.

### Insights

Members primarily use the service for weekday commuting, while casual users display more flexibility, with significant engagement during weekends for leisure activities.

## Seasonal Trends

## Monthly Rides

Peak Month: September

Lowest Month: January

Trend:

Both user types see sharp increases in rides from January to May/June, leveling off during summer months and peaking in September.

Rides decline sharply from September to January.

Members maintain consistently higher monthly ride numbers, averaging 100k more rides per month than casual users.

### Ride Duration by Month

Members show stable trip durations throughout the year, peaking in May (12.96 minutes) and dipping in November and December (10.83 minutes).

Casual users’ trip durations align with seasonal trends, peaking in May (23.67 minutes) and hitting a low in January (14.81 minutes).

### Insights

Members exhibit consistent usage patterns year-round, while casual users are more influenced by seasonal changes, using the service more during warmer months for longer trips.

## Rideable Type Preferences

### Rides by Type

Electric Bikes: Account for 3.0 million rides, with usage evenly split between members (63%) and casual users (37%).

Classic Bikes: Total 2.8 million rides, with a slightly higher member share (65%).

Electric Scooters: 144k rides, heavily skewed toward casual users (59%) compared to members (41%).

### Monthly Ride Trends by Type

Classic bikes are more popular in winter months (January/February), but electric bikes dominate for the remainder of the year.

The introduction of electric scooters in late summer caused a sharp rise in rides, particularly in September, with scooters disproportionately reducing classic bike usage.

### Insights

Members and casual users show similar preferences for classic and electric bikes, but casual users strongly favor electric scooters. This suggests casual users are more flexible and willing to try new options, while members stick to their regular modes of transport.

## Location Trends

Both user types commonly start and end trips at two key locations: West Loop Gate (start) and Merchandise Mart (end). These areas are connected by the Kinzie St Bikeway, a central and bike-friendly route. This infrastructure likely drives high ride numbers for both groups.

### Insights

Convenient and accessible infrastructure benefits both user types, but it particularly facilitates members’ consistent commuting patterns.

## Summary

Members and casual users differ significantly in how they engage with the ride-sharing service:

Usage Patterns: Members focus on short, frequent trips (e.g., commuting), while casual users favor longer, leisure-oriented trips.

Temporal Trends: Members’ usage peaks during weekday commuting hours, while casual users display more flexible patterns, with strong weekend engagement.

Seasonal Trends: Members maintain consistent year-round usage, whereas casual users’ behavior is weather-dependent, peaking in warmer months.

Rideable Preferences: Members and casual users have similar preferences for classic and electric bikes, but casual users strongly favor electric scooters.

Infrastructure Influence: Central routes like the Kinzie St Bikeway drive usage for both groups, but members rely on them more heavily for commuting.

These insights highlight the primary distinctions between members and casual users, with the former representing routine, predictable usage and the latter characterized by flexibility and leisure-driven engagement.
